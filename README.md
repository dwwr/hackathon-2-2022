Homebrew applications running on the Nintendo 3DS.

Utilizes [DevkitPro's](https://devkitpro.org/) 3DS toolchain. DevkitPro provides tools and libraries for developing homebrew across later generations of Nintendo hardware. This repository uses Devkitpro's Makefile boilerplate. Homebrew applications are compiled into a .3dsx file which is served over network and can be run on a modified 3DS console using Homebrew Launcher, a common homebrew tool.
